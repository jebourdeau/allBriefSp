# course 3

The goal of this course is to dive deeper into strings, one of the most common data types in programming.

You will learn how to reverse strings, check if a string is a palindrome, and count the number of vowels in a string.

Your workspace will continue to be a simple folder with a file called `index.js`. In this file, you will define three functions: `reverseString`, `isPalindrome`, and `countVowels`.

Remember to run:
```bash
npm install
```

This is crucial for setting up your environment to run the tests.

To check your progress, `npm test` will run the tests for the array manipulation exercises.

Successful completion will show green results in your terminal.

If you encounter any failures, double-check your logic and syntax.
